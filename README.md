# AMATH 482: Computational Methods for Data Analysis
This repository contains assignments of the course AMATH 482 at the University of Washington, winter 2021. In each folder, there are corresponding MATLAB codes and a written report.

## Assignments and Key Algorithms
* Tracking a submarine using acoustic signiture
  * Tracking the position of a submarine by applying the **fast Fourier transform** and the **Gaussian filter** on the acoustic data.
* Isolating an instrument in an audio file
  * Using the **Gabor transform** to obtain the spectrum of a specific instrument in a music clip.
* Principle component analysis
  * Using the **principle component analysis (PCA)**, a further implementation of the **singular value decomposition (SVD)**, to analyze the energy percent and the displacement of a moving can captured by three cameras in four different situations.
* Classifying Digits
  * Building a **linear discriminant analysis (LDA)** classifier using SVD, and compare its performance on classifying digits along with the **support vector machine (SVM)** and the **decision tree** classifier.
* Background subtraction in video streams
  * Using the **dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)** to separate the foreground and the background of a given video.
